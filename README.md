# department_research_interests

This scripts generates ideas for funders, impact and collaborations based on research interests.

The attached R/Rmarkdown scripts use llama3.2 and mistral to suggest (1) potential funders, (2) potential impact (as defined by the UK REF), (3) colleagues with potentially relevant skills, and (4) potential collaborators within a psychology department. 

The script just calls ollama [https://ollama.com/] to run the large language models. See script for the prompts.
